RWikiBot ChangeLog  

2.0 ** BREAKING RELEASE** - this will break pretty all 1.X bots.  
  - It's smart enough now to handle query-continues! As such, there's a new dependency - deep_merge. Get it - it's in gem.  
  - Made a Page class. now, instead of bot.delete_page(title...), you do page.delete
  - Got rid of the stupid Result class. That was a terrible decision.  
  - edit_page is now save. Part of the Page/class concept
  - Changed user-agent to bot/RWikiBot/2.0
  - page_exists has been replaced with the page attribute "missing" - this aligns with MW's behavior
  - Removed redirects since it doesn't matter anymore now that the API is solidified
  - Removed image_embdedded_in since it's defunct
  - Removed revisions due to limited functionality
  - Removed pageid_to_title because the API is smart enough to not require conversion
  - Made the utilities all private because utilities don't need to be public
  - Shortened up the code considerably by retuning make_request when I can
  - Moved make_request and it's new friend raw_call to utilities because they are.
  - Removed normalize since I can get the "missing" attribute when creating a page, and that's good 'nuff

1.2  
  - Added edit functionality to complete the API
  - Played catchup with a whole lot of methods

1.1
  - Switched from YAML to XML for a handful of reasons, most of which being poorly formatted YAML errors in API
  - Disabled cookies from login since they're terrible and hard to maintain and bad long term practice and the API supports it (you're welcome)
  - Striked the "name" field and "prefix" field from initialize. Those were antiquated anyway.  
  - Reordered the methods to align with documentation
  - Changed User-Agent to bot-RWikiBot/1.1
  - Refined error handling (sorta)  

1.0.10
  - Changed a get back to post since the bug wasn't with me.  

1.0.9
  - Disabled Logging because of permission errors on writing log files as a MediaWiki extension

1.0.8
  - Switched BACK to initialize-time config since calling from a hook didn't play with the files right, I think

1.0.7
  - Added PAGEID_TO_TITLE
  - Turned Logger level up to INFO-  sorry for forgetting that :-)

1.0.6
  - Added VERSION
  - Removed some _more_ debugging code
  - Fixed login code to send back tokens and things, thereby fixing login altogether. Bots are now welcome!

1.0.5
  - Added parameters for queries to the rdoc - save MediaWiki some bandwidth
  - Added BACKLINKS, PAGE_EXISTS?, EMBEDDED_IN, IMAGE_EMBEDDED_IN
  - Fixed a bug in ALL_PAGES, where it wasn't really sending the options hash as part of the request. Oops.  
  - Removed some debug puts
  - Premiered the RWikiBot logo. Not in the source, but it exists now.
  
1.0.4
  - Changed config.yaml to sample-config.yaml
  - Had rake include the sample-config.yaml file
  - Fixed broken cookie code to ask for wikicookieprefix, which is usually dbname+tableprefix

1.0.3
  - Bugfix in config file

1.0.2
  - Changed initialize to ask for a configuration to use, defaulting to 'default'
  - Modified config.yaml to prompt for wikidbprefix, which is the cookie identifier.  
  - PATCH: Changed bake to search use wikidbprefix in cookie name.  

1.0.1
  - Added very basic error handing around the MAKE_REQUEST method since MediaWiki returns invalid YAML  
  - Fixed login method to accept domain value
  - Check for domain being present and set in config.yaml
  - Added redirect? method to return true/false if title is a redirect page
  - Changed from "framework" to "library"

1.0.0 - Initial Version
