<a href="../classes/RWikiBot.html">RWikiBot</a> ChangeLog
</p>
<p>
2.0 ** BREAKING RELEASE** - this will break pretty all 1.X bots.
</p>
<pre>
        - It's smart enough now to handle query-continues! As such, there's a new dependency - deep_merge. Get it - it's in gem.
        - Made a Page class. now, instead of bot.delete_page(title...), you do page.delete
        - Got rid of the stupid Result class. That was a terrible decision.
        - edit_page is now save. Part of the Page/class concept
        - Changed user-agent to bot/RWikiBot/2.0
        - page_exists has been replaced with the page attribute &quot;missing&quot; - this aligns with MW's behavior
        - Removed redirects since it doesn't matter anymore now that the API is solidified
        - Removed image_embdedded_in since it's defunct
        - Removed revisions due to limited functionality
        - Removed pageid_to_title because the API is smart enough to not require conversion
        - Made the utilities all private because utilities don't need to be public
        - Shortened up the code considerably by retuning make_request when I can
        - Moved make_request and it's new friend raw_call to utilities because they are.
        - Removed normalize since I can get the &quot;missing&quot; attribute when creating a page, and that's good 'nuff
</pre>
<p>
1.2
</p>
<pre>
        - Added edit functionality to complete the API
        - Played catchup with a whole lot of methods
</pre>
<p>
1.1
</p>
<pre>
        - Switched from YAML to XML for a handful of reasons, most of which being poorly formatted YAML errors in API
        - Disabled cookies from login since they're terrible and hard to maintain and bad long term practice and the API supports it (you're welcome)
        - Striked the &quot;name&quot; field and &quot;prefix&quot; field from initialize. Those were antiquated anyway.
        - Reordered the methods to align with documentation
        - Changed User-Agent to bot-RWikiBot/1.1
        - Refined error handling (sorta)
</pre>
<p>
1.0.10
</p>
<pre>
        - Changed a get back to post since the bug wasn't with me.
</pre>
<p>
1.0.9
</p>
<pre>
        - Disabled Logging because of permission errors on writing log files as a MediaWiki extension
</pre>
<p>
1.0.8
</p>
<pre>
        - Switched BACK to initialize-time config since calling from a hook didn't play with the files right, I think
</pre>
<p>
1.0.7
</p>
<pre>
        - Added PAGEID_TO_TITLE
        - Turned Logger level up to INFO-  sorry for forgetting that :-)
</pre>
<p>
1.0.6
</p>
<pre>
        - Added VERSION
        - Removed some _more_ debugging code
        - Fixed login code to send back tokens and things, thereby fixing login altogether. Bots are now welcome!
</pre>
<p>
1.0.5
</p>
<pre>
        - Added parameters for queries to the rdoc - save MediaWiki some bandwidth
        - Added BACKLINKS, PAGE_EXISTS?, EMBEDDED_IN, IMAGE_EMBEDDED_IN
        - Fixed a bug in ALL_PAGES, where it wasn't really sending the options hash as part of the request. Oops.
        - Removed some debug puts
        - Premiered the RWikiBot logo. Not in the source, but it exists now.
</pre>
<p>
1.0.4
</p>
<pre>
        - Changed config.yaml to sample-config.yaml
        - Had rake include the sample-config.yaml file
        - Fixed broken cookie code to ask for wikicookieprefix, which is usually dbname+tableprefix
</pre>
<p>
1.0.3
</p>
<pre>
        - Bugfix in config file
</pre>
<p>
1.0.2
</p>
<pre>
        - Changed initialize to ask for a configuration to use, defaulting to 'default'
        - Modified config.yaml to prompt for wikidbprefix, which is the cookie identifier.
        - PATCH: Changed bake to search use wikidbprefix in cookie name.
</pre>
<p>
1.0.1
</p>
<pre>
        - Added very basic error handing around the MAKE_REQUEST method since MediaWiki returns invalid YAML
        - Fixed login method to accept domain value
        - Check for domain being present and set in config.yaml
        - Added redirect? method to return true/false if title is a redirect page
        - Changed from &quot;framework&quot; to &quot;library&quot;
</pre>
<p>
1.0.0 - Initial Version
</p>
