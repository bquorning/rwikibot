New in 2.0 (highlights)
  - It's smart enough now to handle query-continues! As such, there's a new dependency - deep_merge. Get it - it's in gem. 
  - Made a Page class. now, instead of bot.delete_page(title...), you do page.delete
  - Got rid of the stupid Result class. That was a terrible decision. 
  - edit_page is now save. Part of the Page/class concept
  - Changed user-agent to bot/RWikiBot/2.0
